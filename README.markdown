# SCunkworks

An experimental rebase of Sproutcore onto the Ember.js runtime, with the further goal of enabling a 2 file (1 js 1 css) "drop-in" SC distribution method.

This is HIGHLY experimental.

## Tests

1. git clone git@github.com:endash/scunkworks.git
2. cd scunkworks
3. bundle install
4. rake dist
5. open tests/index.html
